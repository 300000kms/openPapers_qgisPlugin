This tool has been developed by [30000Km/s](http://www.300000kms.net) to help [Arrels foundation] (https://www.arrelsfundacio.org) to make the annual survey to count homeless people in Barcelona.

The purpose of this tools is generate a cartography to organize and be used by citizens in crowd surveys where GPS, phones and modern technologies are not precise enought or they need skilled people.


### How it works?

Once you have defined in Qgis the areas of the city you want to explore then the plugin generates an atlas that optimize the subdivision of the regions in paper sheets and coordinates the final documents.

The plugin will generate an atlas divided in ZONES and AREAS, where a zone contains different areas, and each area is printed in different papers according their size.

Once the data is on the paper, it can be scanned and digitized with othe tools that we are developing and testing, even you can create a new map with the small parts collected. 

Also we provide qr code and bar code description for process the survei after it collection.
